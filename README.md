# BitClimb


BitClimb is a 2D platformer game that challenges the player not to fall. As generated platforms fall down the screen at increasing speeds, the player needs to jump between them to stay afloat. The goal of the game is to keep yourself from falling for as long as possible. The longer you stay alive, the more difficult the game becomes. It is programmed in JS using p5.js.
